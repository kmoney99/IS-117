    Click Download and look for Webstorm hit download once you see that. 
4) After Webstorm is downloaded open the app up and it will ask you to login into your jetbrains account to activate your account 
 - Do that once thats done you should be able to use Webstrom. 


**Part 2: Git and Github**

Some Differences between Git and GitHub is that Git is a software and GitHub is a service. 
Git is a command-line tool.	
GitHub is a graphical user interface.

GIT RUNS ON GITHUB

To download git go to this link - (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
To Sign up for github go to this link - (https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)

To do anything in GitHub, you’ll need to create a repository. 
To create a new repository, you’ll hit “new repository” in the upper-right-hand corner. You can then name your repository, 
include a brief description, and check the box that says “initialize this repository with a README.” Finally, you’ll click “create repository.”

By now you should have everything set up and a base understanding of git and github. 


**Branch** - Parallel version of a repository; contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch; 
allows user to work freely without disrupting the "live" version;

**Clone** - Copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server or the act of making that copy; allows user to edit files in preferred editor,
and use Git to track changes without being online, but is connected to the remote version so changes can be synced between the two;

**Commit** - an individual change to a file (or set of files); creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") when user saves a file (except with Git) 
and tracks what changes were made, when, and by who; usually contain a brief description of what changes were made

**Fetch** - Refers to getting the latest changes from an online repository (like GitHub.com) without merging them in; 
changes can be compared to local branches (the code residing on your local machine)

**GIT** -  is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files.

**Github** - is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

**Merge** - Takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork) and applies them into another; often happens as a Pull Request or via the command line; 
can be done automatically via a Pull Request, the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or the command line

**Merge Conflict** - happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge. 
Git can often resolve differences between branches and merge them automatically.

**Push** - Refers to sending committed changes to a remote repository such as GitHub.com; 
when a change is made locally, changes need to made accessible to other users

**Pull** - Refers to fetching in changes and merging; i.e., if someone edits a remote file multiple users are working on, 
those changes need to be incorporated into the local copy so the files are up-to-date.

**Remote** - Version of something that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com; 
can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced

**Repository** - A repository (or repo) is essentially synonymous with the word “project.” A repository stores everything pertinent to a specific project 
including files, images, spreadsheets, data sets, and videos, often sorted into files.
